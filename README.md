### Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends

## Project Objective
This project was designed to address the following analysis goals:

i. Understand customer behaviour

## Tools Used
1. Miicrosoft Excel:
- Data cleaning: This is the removal of all unwanted attachment from your data,ensure there are no missing or inaccurate values provide data quality and consistency
- Data Analysis: Utilizing Excel's pivot tables and charting features, visualizations to uncover trends and insights related to different aspects of the dataset, summarize and filter the data for easier   interpretation, culminates in a visual dashboard which provides an overview of the sales data and allows users to explore key metrics and trends.
- Data Visualization: This provide the necessary context for data to be interpreted and acted upon.
2. SQL: Structured Query Language for quering data
3. Power BI for data modelling
4. Github for Portfolio building

Structured Query Language

The queries for the following are:

- Total number of customers from each region

```
Select Region, Count(CustomerID) As Total_Customers from Customer_Data
group by Region;
```
  
  ```
  SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY Region;
```

2. Most popular subscription type by the number of customers

```
SELECT SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS NumberOfCustomers FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY NumberOfCustomers DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

3. Customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months

```
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(SubscriptionEnd, SubscriptionStart)) AS AvgSubscriptionDuration
FROM CustomerData;
```

5.	Customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months

```
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, SubscriptionType, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd
FROM CustomerData
WHERE DATEDIFF(SubscriptionEnd, SubscriptionStart) > 365;
```

6. Total revenue by subscription type

```
SELECT SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY SubscriptionType;
```

7. Top 3 regions by subscription cancellations

```
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS Cancellations
FROM CustomerData
WHERE Canceled = True
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Cancellations DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

8. Total number of active and canceled subscriptions

```
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Canceled = False THEN 1 END) AS ActiveSubscriptions,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Canceled = True THEN 1 END) AS CanceledSubscriptions
FROM CustomerData;
```
